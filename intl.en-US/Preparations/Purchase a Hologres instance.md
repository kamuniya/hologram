# Purchase a Hologres instance

Before you use Hologres, you must purchase a Hologres instance. This topic describes how to purchase a Hologres instance by using an Alibaba Cloud account.

-   An Alibaba Cloud account is created.
-   Real-name verification is completed.

By default, the system sets the Alibaba Cloud account used to purchase an instance as a superuser of the instance. The superuser has all permissions on the instance.

You can purchase a Hologres instance as a RAM user only after the required permissions are granted to the RAM user by using your Alibaba Cloud account. For more information, see Grant Hologres-related RAM permissions to a RAM user. The procedure of purchasing a Hologres instance for a RAM user is the same as that for an Alibaba Cloud account.

1.  Go to the [Hologres product landing page](https://www.aliyun.com/product/hologram?spm=5176.224200.h2v3icoap.186.58e16ed61Zjftc).

2.  Click **Free Beta**.

3.  Select a billing method and set the parameters.

4.  Click **Buy Now**.

5.  On the **Confirm Order** page, verify the information of the purchased instance, such as the billing method, instance name, resources, and region. Read and agree to the terms of service by selecting the check box.

6.  Click **Pay**.

7.  Complete the payment on the **Purchase** page.

    After an instance is purchased, go to the [Hologres console](https://hologram.console.aliyun.com/#/instance) to view the instance information. For more information about how to use the Hologres console, see [Hologres Console Overview](/intl.en-US/Instance Manage/Hologres Console/Hologres Console Overview.md).

    Hologres is compatible with PostgreSQL. You can connect to a Hologres instance from the PostgreSQL client for data analytics. You can also use extract, transform, load \(ETL\) or Business Intelligence \(BI\) tools to connect to a Hologres instance.

    -   For more information about the PostgreSQL client, see [Use Hologres from the PostgreSQL client](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Use Hologres from the PostgreSQL client.md).
